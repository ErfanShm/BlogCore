## 📋 Requirements

1.  **Software:**
    *   Python 3.8+ (inferred from `pyproject.toml` `requires-python`)
    *   `uv` (fast Python package installer and resolver) - Install globally: `pip install uv`

2.  **Dependencies:** (Managed via `pyproject.toml` and `uv`)
    The project dependencies are defined in `pyproject.toml`.
    *   `Flask`
    *   `requests`
    *   `markdown`
    *   `python-docx`
    *   `google-api-python-client`
    *   `google-auth-httplib2`
    *   `google-auth-oauthlib`
    *   `python-dotenv`

3.  **Environment Setup:**
    *   **Google Cloud Credentials:** Obtain a Google Cloud service account key file (`credentials.json`) with access to Google Drive API. Place this file in the project root.
    *   **Environment Variables (`.env`):** A `.env` template (`.env.template`) will be created by `setup.bat`. You must then manually create and fill your `.env` file based on this template, replacing placeholders with your actual API keys and configuration settings.

    ```env
    # AvvalAI API Key
    API_KEY=your_aval_api_key_here

    # Base URL for AvvalAI API (e.g., https://api.avalapis.ir)
    BASE_URL=https://api.avalapis.ir

    # Endpoint for AvvalAI Chat Completions (e.g., /v1/chat/completions)
    ENDPOINT=/v1/chat/completions

    # Google API Key for Custom Search Engine
    API_KEY_GOOGLE=your_google_api_key_here

    # Google Custom Search Engine ID
    ENGINE_ID_GOOGLE=your_google_cse_id_here

    # Google Drive Folder ID where generated documents will be uploaded
    GOOGLE_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID=your_google_drive_folder_id_here

    # Path to Google service account credentials file (typically 'credentials.json')
    GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE=credentials.json
    ```

## 💻 Installation & Launch Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/BlogCore.git # Replace with your actual repository URL
    cd BlogCore
    ```
2.  **Run the Setup Script (Windows)**
    This script (`setup.bat`) automates the environment setup.
    It will:
    *   Create a `.env.template` (if it doesn't exist).
    *   Create a virtual environment (`.venv`) using `uv`.
    *   Install all Python dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml` and lock them (or synchronize with an existing `uv.lock`).

    ```bash
    setup.bat
    ```
    **Important:** After running the script, a `.env.template` will be created. You must **manually create a file named `.env`** in the project root and populate it with your actual API keys and Google IDs, using `.env.template` as a guide.

3.  **Launch the Application**
    First, activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    .venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows (from project root)
    # For macOS/Linux users, it would be: source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
    Then, run the Flask application:
    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```
    The Flask development server will start, typically accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation Details

### Core Flask Application Structure
The application uses a standard Flask blueprint structure. `run.py` is the entry point, `app/__init__.py` initializes the Flask app, `app/routes.py` defines the web routes, and `app/services.py` encapsulates the core business logic and API integrations.

### Dependency Management with `uv`
The project leverages `uv` for fast and reliable Python dependency management.
*   Dependencies are declared in `pyproject.toml`.
*   `uv sync` is used to create and synchronize the virtual environment with the exact package versions.

### Document Handling and Conversion
*   **Markdown to DOCX:** The `create_word_document` function (in `app/services.py`) uses the `python-docx` library to convert Markdown text into a `.docx` file. It's specifically configured for Persian language support, including right-to-left (RTL) text alignment and the "Vazirmatn" font. It handles Markdown headings, lists, tables, and inline bold formatting.
*   **Word Count:** The `count_words_fa` helper function uses regex to accurately count Persian and English words.

### Cloud Service Integration
*   **Google Drive Upload:** The `upload_as_google_doc` function (in `app/services.py`) utilizes the `google-api-python-client` to upload `.docx` files to a specified Google Drive folder. It uploads them as Google Docs, ensuring they are accessible and editable in Google Workspace. It also cleans up the local `.docx` file after successful upload.
*   **Google Custom Search:** The `perform_Google_Search` function (in `app/services.py`) integrates with the Google Custom Search JSON API to fetch top search results for a given keyword, providing valuable competitor data to the AI.

### Localization & SEO Prompt Engineering
The prompts sent to AvvalAI are extensively detailed, acting as a "senior SEO strategist" and "world-class Persian content writer." They include instructions for:
*   EEAT principles (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness).
*   Target audience, tone, and specific word counts.
*   Analysis of competitor content structure and themes.
*   Adherence to custom content structures (headings).
*   SEO-friendly language, natural keyword integration, and readability.
*   Instructions to avoid AI detection patterns, ensuring human-like output.
*   For the brief generation, the AI is prompted to return a very specific JSON structure with detailed SEO and content planning elements in Persian.
